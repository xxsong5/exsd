## Special Thanks

Special thanks to [krolaw/xsd](github.com/krolaw/xsd) and [Michal Pristas](https://github.com/michalpristas) and [Travis Cline](https://github.com/tmc) for independently providing solutions for returning validation errors.

## WOW!

An employee of HP Inc requested I attach a licence so it could be used in their "FitStation" platform - Awesome.
